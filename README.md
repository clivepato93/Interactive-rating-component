## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I learned how to overcome event listeners not working on Safari ios as the functionality was working everywhere else.

I adjusted my div's from

```html
    <div class="btn">1</div> 
```
```html
    <button class="btn" value="1">1</button> 
```

```css
    .btn{
        border-radius: 50%;
        width: 5rem;
        height:5rem;
        background-color: var(--dark-blue);
        color: var(--medium-grey);
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center ;
        align-items: center;
        font-size: 1.7rem;
        cursor:pointer;
        border: 2px solid var(--dark-blue);
    }

```
